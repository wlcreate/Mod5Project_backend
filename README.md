# Pit Stop Backend
This is the Ruby on Rails API for Pit Stop. Pit Stop is a travel journal web application that changes the way users remember their trips. Instead of creating daily journal entries, users add places they visited on a trip and create reflections on those places. This was inspired by the idea of [memory space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_space_(social_science)) (Les Lieux de MÃ©moire) in that our memories are often tied to the places we have been.
