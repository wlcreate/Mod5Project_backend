# Pit Stop Backend
This is the Ruby on Rails API for Pit Stop. Pit Stop is a travel journal web application that changes the way users remember their trips. Instead of creating daily journal entries, users add places they visited on a trip and create reflections on those places. This was inspired by the idea of [memory space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_space_(social_science)) (Les Lieux de MÃ©moire) in that our memories are often tied to the places we have been.

### Downloading this project
1. Clone this repo and cd into the folder
2. Bundle install to get all required dependencies
```

3. Install Figaro via the Terminal (which creates the ```application.yaml``` file and adds it to .gitignore)
```
bundle exec figaro install
```
4. Go to ```./config/application.yml``` and add your Cloudinary cloud_name, api_key, and api_secret
```
cloudinary_cloud_name: "sample" 
cloudinary_api_key: "sample"
cloudinary_api_secret: "sample"
```
5. Set up the PostgreSQL database
